echo "UiScrollView & UiPage Wheel Event Fix Testing"
echo "=============================================="
echo ""

echo "üîß CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "  1. Added UiPage::onWheel() method to forward wheel events to content area"
echo "  2. Fixed UiScrollView scrollbar alpha animation (semi-transparent base state)"
echo "  3. Enhanced scrollbar hover detection and visibility triggers"
echo "  4. Added comprehensive test coverage"
echo ""

echo "üìã MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST:"
echo ""

echo "1. MOUSE WHEEL SCROLLING:"
echo "   ‚úì Open HomePage (uses scrollView wrapper)"
echo "   ‚úì Scroll with mouse wheel - content should scroll smoothly"
echo "   ‚úì Verify wheel events work both up and down"
echo "   ‚úì Confirm scrolling only works when content overflows viewport"
echo ""

echo "2. SCROLLBAR VISIBILITY & ANIMATION:"
echo "   ‚úì With scrollable content:"
echo "     - Scrollbar should be visible at 30% opacity by default"
echo "     - Becomes 100% opaque when scrolling with wheel"
echo "     - Becomes 100% opaque when hovering over scrollbar area"
echo "     - Fades back to 30% after ~900ms of inactivity"
echo "   ‚úì Without scrollable content:"
echo "     - No scrollbar should be visible"
echo ""

echo "3. SCROLLBAR INTERACTION:"
echo "   ‚úì Hover over scrollbar thumb - should become more opaque"
echo "   ‚úì Click and drag thumb - should scroll content smoothly"
echo "   ‚úì Click on track - should jump scroll by page"
echo "   ‚úì All interactions should trigger opacity animation"
echo ""

echo "4. THEME COMPATIBILITY:"
echo "   ‚úì Switch between light and dark themes"
echo "   ‚úì Scrollbar colors should update appropriately:"
echo "     - Light theme: dark scrollbar on light background"
echo "     - Dark theme: light scrollbar on dark background"
echo "   ‚úì Hover/press states should remain visible in both themes"
echo ""

echo "5. PAGE AREAS TO TEST:"
echo "   ‚úì HomePage - uses scrollView() wrapper"
echo "   ‚úì Formula details view - uses scrollView() wrapper"
echo "   ‚úì Any page with content that overflows viewport height"
echo ""

echo "6. EDGE CASES:"
echo "   ‚úì Wheel events outside content area should not affect scrolling"
echo "   ‚úì Wheel events in title area should not scroll content"
echo "   ‚úì Rapidly switching between pages should not break scrollbar state"
echo "   ‚úì Resizing window should update scrollbar visibility correctly"
echo ""

echo "üèóÔ∏è BUILDING & RUNNING:"
echo "  mkdir -p build"
echo "  cd build"
echo "  cmake .."
echo "  make -j\$(nproc)"
echo "  ./FangJia"
echo ""

echo "üß™ RUNNING TESTS:"
echo "  cd build"
echo "  make run_tests"
echo "  # or"
echo "  ctest --output-on-failure"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ EXPECTED RESULTS:"
echo "  - Smooth mouse wheel scrolling in all scrollable areas"
echo "  - Visible scrollbars that respond to interaction"
echo "  - Proper fade animations (transparent ‚Üí opaque ‚Üí transparent)"
echo "  - No wheel events 'lost' or ignored"
echo "  - Consistent behavior across light/dark themes"
echo ""

echo "‚ùå KNOWN LIMITATIONS:"
echo "  - Only vertical scrolling is supported (by design)"
echo "  - Scrollbar width is fixed at 6px (Fluent Design)"
echo "  - Horizontal scrolling not implemented in this container"
echo ""
