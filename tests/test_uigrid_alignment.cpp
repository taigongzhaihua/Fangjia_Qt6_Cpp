/**
 * Manual verification guide for UiGrid center alignment fix
 * 
 * This file documents the expected behavior changes after the alignment fix.
 * Since placeInCell is private, unit testing requires creating integration tests
 * with the full UI system.
 * 
 * Testing steps:
 * 1. Create a Grid with fixed pixel columns/rows (e.g., 200x100 cells)
 * 2. Add components with natural size smaller than cell (e.g., 100x50)
 * 3. Set h=Center, v=Center alignment
 * 4. Verify components appear visually centered in their cells
 * 5. Test h=End, v=End alignment - verify no 1px overflow or clipping
 * 6. Test h=Stretch, v=Stretch - ensure content still fills cells
 * 
 * Expected behavior changes:
 * - Before fix: Center-aligned items stick to Start edge due to full-width measurement
 * - After fix: Center-aligned items appear properly centered using natural width
 * - Before fix: End-aligned items may have 1px offset due to QRect::right() usage
 * - After fix: End-aligned items position correctly without offset

// The actual test code would require access to internal layout methods,
// so practical testing should be done through integration tests or
// visual verification in the actual application.
