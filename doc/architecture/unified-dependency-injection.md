# Unified Dependency Injection System - Implementation Guide

This document describes the implementation of the unified dependency injection system, which is the concrete implementation of the first optimization suggestion from the architecture analysis.

## Overview

The unified dependency injection system provides a unified interface through the `UnifiedDependencyProvider` class to access the current dual DI systems:
- Boost.DI Container (for Formula domain)
- Temporary Service Locator (for Settings/Theme domain)

## Core Components

### 1. UnifiedDependencyProvider

The unified dependency provider is the core of the system, providing a templated service resolution interface:

```cpp
// Get service instances (automatically select the correct DI system)
auto& provider = UnifiedDependencyProvider::instance();
auto formulaService = provider.get<IFormulaService>();        // Uses Boost.DI
auto settingsUseCase = provider.get<GetSettingsUseCase>();    // Uses Legacy Provider
```

#### Key Features:
- **Compile-time System Selection**: Automatically selects the correct DI system through template specialization
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of service types and system matching
- **Unified Interface**: Developers don't need to understand implementation details
- **Backward Compatibility**: Doesn't break existing code

### 2. DependencyMigrationTool

The migration tool tracks and manages the migration process from the old system to the new system:

```cpp
auto& tool = DependencyMigrationTool::instance();
auto report = tool.generateMigrationReport();
// Output: Migration Status: 1/8 services migrated (12.5%)
```

#### Features:
- Track migration status of all services
- Generate migration progress reports
- Validate functionality of migrated services
- Provide migration guidance

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```cpp
// 1. Initialize at application startup
auto& unifiedDeps = UnifiedDependencyProvider::instance();
unifiedDeps.initialize(legacyProvider, formulaService);

// 2. Use anywhere dependencies are needed
auto service = unifiedDeps.get<ServiceType>();
```

### Check Migration Status

```cpp
// Compile-time check of service management system - After Phase 3, all services migrated
bool isBoostDI = provider.isBoostDIManaged<IFormulaService>();       // true
bool isAlsoBoostDI = provider.isBoostDIManaged<GetSettingsUseCase>(); // true (Phase 3 migration)

// Runtime status description
const char* status = provider.getMigrationStatus<IFormulaService>();
// Output: "Boost.DI (✅ migrated)"
```

### Generate Migration Report

```cpp
auto& tool = DependencyMigrationTool::instance();
auto report = tool.generateMigrationReport();

std::cout << "Total Services: " << report.totalServices << std::endl;
std::cout << "Migrated: " << report.migratedServices << std::endl;
std::cout << "Completion: " << report.completionPercentage << "%" << std::endl;
```

## Architectural Benefits

### 1. Simplified Development Experience
- Unified API reduces learning curve
- Compile-time type checking improves safety
- Automatic system selection reduces errors

### 2. Progressive Migration
- Supports coexistence of two systems
- Doesn't break existing functionality
- Controllable migration pace

### 3. Observability
- Clear migration status tracking
- Detailed progress reports
- Validation tools ensure quality

## Current Status

### Completed
- ✅ Unified interface implementation
- ✅ Compile-time system detection
- ✅ Migration tool infrastructure
- ✅ Usage examples and documentation
- ✅ Phase 3: Gradually migrate services to Boost.DI

### Service Migration Status (Phase 3 Complete)
- ✅ IFormulaService → Boost.DI (completed)
- ✅ GetSettingsUseCase → Boost.DI (Phase 3 complete)
- ✅ UpdateSettingsUseCase → Boost.DI (Phase 3 complete)
- ✅ GetThemeModeUseCase → Boost.DI (Phase 3 complete)
- ✅ SetThemeModeUseCase → Boost.DI (Phase 3 complete)
- ✅ ToggleThemeUseCase → Boost.DI (Phase 3 complete)
- ✅ GetRecentTabUseCase → Boost.DI (Phase 3 complete)
- ✅ SetRecentTabUseCase → Boost.DI (Phase 3 complete)

**All 8 services successfully migrated to Boost.DI!**

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Remove Legacy System (Ready to start)
Since Phase 3 is complete, final cleanup can now begin:
1. Remove DependencyProvider (all services migrated)
2. Clean up legacy code in UnifiedDependencyProvider
3. Update to pure Boost.DI system
4. Remove unnecessary template specialization code

### Phase 2: Create Migration Layer (Completed)
1. ✅ Add Settings domain Boost.DI bindings in CompositionRoot
2. ✅ Create new unified injector configuration
3. ✅ Update service instantiation code

### Phase 3: Gradually Migrate Services (Completed)
1. ✅ Start with a simple use case (e.g., GetSettingsUseCase)
2. ✅ Add Boost.DI bindings
3. ✅ Update template specialization markers
4. ✅ Verify functionality
5. ✅ Repeat for all other services

### Phase 4: Remove Legacy System
1. After all services are migrated
2. Remove DependencyProvider
3. Clean up legacy code in UnifiedDependencyProvider
4. Update to pure Boost.DI system

## Best Practices

### 1. Service Definition
- All services should have interface abstractions
- Use dependency injection-friendly constructors
- Avoid circular dependencies

### 2. Migration Strategy
- Migrate one domain at a time
- Thoroughly test behavior consistency before and after migration
- Maintain backward compatibility until complete migration

### 3. Error Handling
- Handle service resolution failures
- Provide clear error messages
- Implement graceful degradation mechanisms
